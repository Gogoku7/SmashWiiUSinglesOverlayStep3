# SmashWiiUSinglesOverlayStep3
Step 3 of a project to create a dynamically editable overlay for Super Smash Bros. Wii U Singles usable for any tournament streamers using HTML, CSS and C#.

Changes from Step 2:
- The manager solution/application has been added to the project, meaning you don't have to manually edit css files!
- Player Ports and Player Backgrounds are now seperated.

Anyone is allowed to clone this repository and create their own overlay manager if they feel it lacks some functionality 


I kept the code as simple and seperate in different functions as possible, to make it easier to understand for beginners in programming, anyone is allowed






At this step, the overlay doesn't dynamically update whenever the css is altered, you have to move back and forward between the scene with the overlay and another scene to show an updated overlay.
